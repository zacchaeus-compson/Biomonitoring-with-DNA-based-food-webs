# Biomonitoring-with-DNA-based-food-webs
This is the project repository associated with the Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution paper, "Network-based biomonitoring: exploring freshwater food webs with stable isotope analysis and DNA metabarcoding."  This paper is part of the Research Topic, "A Next-Generation of Biomonitoring to Detect Global Ecosystem Change."

Included in this repository are the following files associated with the project:

(1) raw data files;
(2) post-bioinformatic DNA file with the location, espressed as lat-long, of each ESV;
(3) denoised fasta ESV and global denoised files;
(4) a table including metabarcoding stats of ESVs reported for steps along the bioinfomatic pipeline; and
(5) R code for (a) generating heuristic food webs and extracting their associated network properties, (b) all statistical analyses, and (c) all figures presented in the manuscript.
